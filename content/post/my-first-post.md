I am planning to use this blog to create my own event log about software to record things like ideas come up my mind, conclusions of my evaluations, takeaways after reading materials (books, blogs), explanations about how things work, sentences worth to remember and finally things that I always forget and re-google.

Some examples:

- > Do not use the private key for encryption! Only for signing! Use the 
  > public key for encryption and the private key for decryption!

- > Why buy/add servers when the software is the problem?

- Nginx generates etag header using `hex(last_modified) + "-" + hex(content_length)`

- Netflix is using *m4.large* (8 GB RAM) instances for their Zuul push servers and they are able to handle 84k connections comfortably on a single server.
